## Overview
There have been many advanced technology in the field of medical sciences.One of the initial breakthrough in medicine is in the diagnosis process. Especially Lungs,Heart.In early days doctor used to manually view the Xray copies and detect whether the patient has any problem or not.Due to the arrival of machine learning the process requires no human intervention and AI has been acing since then. Here is one such application where CNN is used to classify whether the person has pneumonia disease or not.

## Motivation
This was my first time using CNN algorithm. It is really amusing to find the width of real application in case of CNN . Pneumonia dataset is a popular large dataset to start using CNN algorithm and I have explored a lot on image processing and model building in this project

## Objectives of project
1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Image preprocessing
3. Building Deep learning model(CNN)
4. Evaluation of model
